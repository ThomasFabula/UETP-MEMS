The European Commission has published a "Report of 1994 activities of the Community action programme for Education and Training for Technology (COMETT)" (COM(95)409 final).

The Community action programme for Education and Training for Technology (COMETT) was adopted in July 1986. An initial preparatory year was followed by a first three-year action plan (COMETT I), from 1987 to 1989, and then a second five-year action plan (COMETT II) from 1990-1994.

This latest report includes:

- Background on the origins and objectives of the COMETT programme;
- Characteristics, development and results of the programme in 1994;
- Programme management in 1994;
- Background to the COMETT II evaluation exercise.

As an overview, COMETT activities in 1994 included support to and funding of:

- Over 7,800 transnational student placements;
- 250 personnel exchanges from universities to industry;
- Approximately 700 joint training courses benefiting 175,513 Europeans;
- The development of a vast range of training materials including videos, CD-I, CD-ROM, audio cassettes, books and slides.

In its last year of operation, the programme consolidated its extensive network of university-industry cooperation providing vital links throughout Europe. It also continued to contribute to the enrichment, transparency and quality of advanced technology training. COMETT University Enterprise Training Partnerships (UETPs) were, moreover, actively involved in preparing for the new Community programmes in education and training (SOCRATES, LEONARDO DA VINCI).

The report also includes: a statistical overview of the programmes activities in 1994; a list of COMETT pilot projects; a list of COMETT publications in 1994; a list of COMETT Committee Members; and a list of COMETT Information Centres throughout Europe.
